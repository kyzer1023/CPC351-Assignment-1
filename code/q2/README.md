# Question 2: travel costs and routing

## Current status

- **Q2(a) (Data cleaning & 75th-percentile cost matrix)**: Implemented in
  `assignment_files/q2a_cost_matrix.R`. Reads raw travel logs, filters for Rainy Morning,
  validates coordinates, cleans road closure records (`NA` and `-1`), calculates
  the 75th percentile per directed route, assigns severe penalties, and outputs
  the cost matrix, filtered log, and heatmap.
- **Q2(b) (Nearest Neighbour routing)**: Implemented in
  `assignment_files/nearest_neighbour.R`. Solves the Hamiltonian tour from any starting
  point (default `P1`), visits all points, handles deterministic tie-breaking,
  adds the closing return edge, tracks penalties, and formats output summaries.
  Verified by 10 unit test suites in `assignment_files/test_nearest_neighbour.R` and a
  standalone in-memory demonstration in `assignment_files/synthetic_demo.R`.
- **End-to-end pipeline integration**: Connected. Running `assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2`
  executes the complete sequence: raw travel logs -> Q2(a) cleaning & 75th-percentile
  cost matrix -> Q2(b) Nearest Neighbour routing -> artifact exports.
  Strict input selection is enforced: default input skips honestly when absent,
  and synthetic development data must be requested explicitly.

## Input Selection Policy

- **Default Execution (`Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2`)**: Searches for the real grading dataset
  at `assignment_files/ahmad_travel_logs.csv`. If absent, skips cleanly and reports missing input;
  **never silently substitutes synthetic dummy data**.
- **Explicit CSV Path**: Pass any travel log explicitly, e.g.:
  `Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2 "C:/path/to/ahmad_travel_logs.csv"`
- **Explicit Synthetic Development Data**: Pass the synthetic log path:
  `Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2 "assignment_files/ahmad_travel_logs_synthetic.csv"`
  When the synthetic fixture is used, results are clearly labeled in the console
  and output files are prefixed with `synthetic_` so they cannot be mistaken
  for unseen grading data.
- **Missing or Malformed Explicit Paths**: Raise immediate descriptive errors;
  they are never masked by dummy data fallback.
- **Standalone Q2(a) CLI (`assignment_files/q2a_cost_matrix.R`)**: Enforces the same input policy
  without automatic fallback.

## Commands

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
# Project pipeline runner (default real input: skips honestly if absent)
Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2

# Run pipeline on a specified real/grading travel log
Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2 "C:/path/to/ahmad_travel_logs.csv"

# Run pipeline on the explicit development synthetic dataset
Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2 "assignment_files/ahmad_travel_logs_synthetic.csv"

# Run pipeline on the synthetic forced-penalty return dataset
Rscript assignment_files/run_assignment.R q2 "assignment_files/forced_penalty_return.csv"

# Standalone Q2(a) runner (builds cost matrix, filtered log, and heatmap)
Rscript assignment_files/q2a_cost_matrix.R "assignment_files/ahmad_travel_logs_synthetic.csv"

# Pipeline integration & input-selection tests (9 test suites)
Rscript assignment_files/test_pipeline.R

# Q2(a) cleaning & matrix tests (12 test suites)
Rscript assignment_files/test_q2a_cost_matrix.R

```

## Running Q2(b) against an in-memory cost matrix

```r
source("assignment_files/nearest_neighbour.R")

# cost_matrix: 10 x 10 numeric matrix with row/col names P1..P10
# penalty_matrix: optional 10 x 10 logical matrix (TRUE where edge is penalized)
result <- run_q2b_routing(
  cost_matrix = cost_matrix,
  start_point = "P1",
  penalty_matrix = penalty_matrix,
  output_dir = "outputs/q2",
  output_prefix = "q2b_tour"
)
```

For smaller test fixtures ($N \ge 2$), call:
`run_nearest_neighbour(cost_matrix, start_point = "P1", penalty_matrix = NULL)`.

## Q2(a) Data Cleaning and Severe Penalty Calculation

The Q2(a) pipeline filters records where `Weather == "Rainy"` and `Time_of_Day == "Morning"`,
retaining records whose coordinates match the 10 assigned points $P_1 \dots P_{10}$.

### Cleaning Decisions and Invalid-Value Treatments
- **Severe Road Closures**: Records with `Travel_Time_Minutes == -1` or `NA` are excluded
  prior to aggregation per the assignment brief.
- **Other Negatives, Non-Finites, and Malformed Text**: Negative values other than `-1`,
  non-finite numbers (`Inf`, `-Inf`, `NaN`), and malformed text are dropped as unusable.
- **Zero-Duration Assumption**: For distinct-point journeys ($P_i \ne P_j$), durations of
  `0.0` minutes are treated as physical anomalies / unusable measurement errors and
  excluded. This is documented as our group's explicit data-cleaning decision, not a
  stated requirement in the brief.

### Route-Status Distinctions in Metadata
Before dropping unusable rows, route evidence for each directed pair is categorized:
1. `usable_history`: At least one valid positive finite observation ($t > 0$).
2. `closure_only`: All records for the route are closures (`NA` or `-1`), with no other invalids.
3. `other_invalid`: Observations contain invalid values (e.g. zero, other negatives, malformed,
   or mixed closure and other invalids). Mixed closure/invalid routes are never labelled `closure_only`.
4. `no_observations`: Zero Rainy Morning records match the coordinate pair.

### Quantile and Penalty Calculation
For each directed pair $(P_i, P_j)$, the 75th percentile is computed using
`quantile(..., probs = 0.75, type = 7)`. If a route has no usable travel history, it is
assigned a severe penalty:

```text
penalty = 11 * M + 1 minute
```
where `M` is the maximum valid observed 75th-percentile cost across off-diagonal pairs.
Because a valid 10-point tour has 10 legs with total cost at most $10 \times M$, a single
penalty edge ($11 \times M + 1$) costs more than any conceivable all-valid tour.

- **No-Valid-Data Fallback**: If an unseen dataset contains zero usable travel times across
  all routes, the function avoids mathematical collapse to `-Inf` or `1` by applying a
  documented positive finite fallback penalty (default `99999`) and emitting a clear warning.

## Q2(a) -> Q2(b) Integration Contract

To connect Q2(a) directly to Q2(b):

1. **Cost Matrix (`cost_matrix`)**:
   - Base R numeric `10 x 10` matrix (`is.matrix(M) && is.numeric(M)`).
   - Rows represent **origins**; columns represent **destinations**.
   - `rownames(M)` and `colnames(M)` must match in the same order and contain
     all 10 points `P1, P2, ..., P10`.
   - Off-diagonal entries must be finite and nonnegative (`>= 0`).
   - Diagonal entries (`Pi -> Pi`) represent self-travel and are set to `0`.

2. **Penalty Metadata (`penalty_matrix`)**:
   - A `10 x 10` logical matrix (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) with matching row and column
     names, where `TRUE` marks impassable routes assigned artificial penalties.
   - May be passed via the `penalty_matrix` argument or as an attribute
     `attr(M, "penalty_matrix")`. If omitted, penalty status is reported as
     `"unknown"`.

3. **Pipeline Integration**:
   - `assignment_files/q2a_cost_matrix.R` defines `build_q2a_cost_matrix(input_path, points = NULL)`
     returning `list(cost_matrix = M, penalty_matrix = P, penalty_value = V, ...)`.
   - `assignment_files/q2_main.R` and `assignment_files/run_assignment.R` execute the complete sequence automatically:
     raw CSV -> Q2(a) cleaning/cost matrix -> Q2(b) Nearest Neighbour routing -> CSV and plot exports.

Write cleaned or aggregated data to `data/processed/q2/` and cost matrices,
route summaries, validation output, and figures to `outputs/q2/`. Insert selected
results into the Question 2 section of the
[shared Google Docs report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAB7_rqw0hhjneBch7KhtM-GNt_AlFTzSP1gphYUyOE/edit?usp=drive_link)
and explain the cleaning, penalties, and route selection there.
